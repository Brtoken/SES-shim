See the [README](./README.md) for a description of the global `lockdown` function
installed by the SES-shim.
Essentially, calling `lockdown` turns a JavaScript system into a SES system,
with enforced ocap (object-capability) security.
Here we explain the configuration options to the lockdown function.

# `lockdown` Options

For every safety-relevant options setting, if the option is omitted
it defaults to `'safe'`. For these options, the tradeoff is safety vs
compatibility, though note that a tremendous amount of legacy code, not
written to run under SES, does run compatibly under SES even with all of these
options set to `'safe'`. You should only consider an `'unsafe'` option if
you find you need it and are able to evaluate the risks.

The `stackFiltering` option trades off stronger filtering of stack traceback to
minimize distractions vs completeness for tracking down a bug hidden in
obscure places. The `overrideTaming` option trades off better code
compatibility vs better tool compatibility.

Each option is explained in its own section below.

| option           | default setting  | other settings | about |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| `regExpTaming`   | `'safe'`    | `'unsafe'`     | `RegExp.prototype.compile` |
| `localeTaming`   | `'safe'`    | `'unsafe'`     | `toLocaleString`           |
| `consoleTaming`  | `'safe'`    | `'unsafe'`     | deep stacks                |
| `errorTaming`    | `'safe'`    | `'unsafe'`     | `errorInstance.stack`      |
| `stackFiltering` | `'concise'` | `'verbose'`    | deep stacks signal/noise   |
| `overrideTaming` | `'moderate'` | `'min'`       | override mistake antidote  |

## `regExpTaming` Options

**Background**: In standard plain JavaScript, the builtin
`RegExp.prototype.compile` method may violate the object invariants of frozen
`RegExp` instances. This violates assumptions elsewhere, and so can be
used to corrupt other guarantees. For example, the JavaScript `Proxy`
abstraction preserves the object invariants only if its target does. It was
designed under the assumption that these invariants are never broken. If a
non-conforming object is available, it can be used to construct a proxy
object that is also non-conforming.

```js
lockdown(); // regExpTaming defaults to 'safe'
// or
lockdown({ regExpTaming: 'safe' }); // Delete RegExp.prototype.compile
// vs
lockdown({ regExpTaming: 'unsafe' }); // Preserve RegExp.prototype.compile
```

The `regExpTaming` default `'safe'` setting deletes this dangerous method. The
`'unafe'` setting preserves it for maximal compatibility at the price of some
risk.

**Background**: In de facto plain JavaScript, the legacy `RegExp` static
methods like `RegExp.lastMatch` are an unsafe global
[overt communications channel](https://agoric.com/taxonomy-of-security-issues/).
They reveal on the `RegExp` constructor information derived from the last match
made by any `RegExp` instance&mdash;a bizarre form of non-local causality.
These static methods are currently part of de facto
JavaScript but not yet part of the standard. The
[Legacy RegExp static methods](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-legacy-features)
proposal would standardize them as *normative optional* and deletable, meaning
   * A conforming JavaScript engine may omit them
   * A shim may delete them and have the resulting state still conform
     to the specification of an initial JavaScript state.

All these legacy `RegExp` static methods are currently removed under all
settings of the `regExpTaming` option.
So far this has not caused any compatibility problems.
If it does, then we may decide to support them, but *only* under the
`'unsafe'` setting and *only* on the `RegExp`  constructor of the start
compartment. The `RegExp` constructor shared by other compartments will remain
safe and powerless.

## `localeTaming` Options

**Background**: In standard plain JavaScript, the builtin methods with
 "`Locale`" or "`locale`" in their name&mdash;`toLocaleString`,
`toLocaleDateString`, `toLocaleTimeString`, `toLocaleLowerCase`,
`toLocaleUpperCase`, and `localeCompare`&mdash;have a global behavior that is
not fully determined by the language spec, but rather varies with location and
culture, which is their point. However, by placing this information of shared
primordial prototypes, it cannot differ per comparment, and so one compartment
cannot virtualize the locale for code running in another compartment. Worse, on
some engines the behavior of these methods may change at runtime as the machine
is "moved" between different locales,
i.e., if the operating system's locale is reconfigured while JavaScript
code is running.

```js
lockdown(); // localeTaming defaults to 'safe'
// or
lockdown({ localeTaming: 'safe' }); // Alias toLocaleString to toString, etc
// vs
lockdown({ localeTaming: 'unsafe' }); // Allow locale-specific behavior
```

The `localeTaming` default `'safe'` option replaces each of these methods with
the corresponding non-locale-specific method. `Object.prototype.toLocaleString`
becomes just another name for `Object.prototype.toString`. The `'unsafe'`
setting preserves the original behavior for maximal compatibility at the price
of reproducibility and fingerprinting. Aside from fingerprinting, the risk that
this slow non-determinism opens a
[communications channel](https://agoric.com/taxonomy-of-security-issues/)
is negligible.

## `consoleTaming` Options

**Background**: Most JavaScript environments provide a `console` object on the
global object with interesting information hiding properties. JavaScript code
can use the `console` to send information to the console's logging output, but
cannot see that output. The `console` is a *write-only device*. The logging
output is normally placed where a human programmer, who is in a controlling
position over that computation, can see the output. This output is, accordingly,
formatted mostly for human consumption; typically for diagnosing problems.

Given these constraints, it is both safe and helpful for the `console` to reveal
to the human programmer information that it would not reveal to the objects it
interacts with. SES amplifies this special relationship to reveal
to the programmer much more information than would be revealed by the normal
`console`. To do so, by default during `lockdown` SES virtualizes the builtin
`console`, by replacing it with a wrapper. The wrapper is a virtual `console`
that implements the standard `console` API mostly by forwarding to the original
wrapped `console`.
In addition, the virtual `console` has a special relationship with
error objects and with the SES `assert` package, so that errors can report yet
more diagnostic information that should remain hidden from other objects. See
the [error README](./src/error/README.md) for an in depth explanation of this
relationship between errors, `assert` and the virtual `console`.

```js
lockdown(); // consoleTaming defaults to 'safe'
// or
lockdown({ consoleTaming: 'safe' }); // Wrap start console to show deep stacks
// vs
lockdown({ consoleTaming: 'unsafe' }); // Leave original start console in place
```

The `consoleTaming: 'unsafe'` setting leaves the original console in place.
The `assert` package and error objects will continue to work, but the `console`
logging output will not show any of this extra information.

The risk is that the original platform-provided `console` object often has
additional methods beyond the de facto `console` "standards". Under the
`'unsafe'` setting we do not remove them.
We do not know whether any of these additional
methods violate ocap security. Until we know otherwise, we should assume these
are unsafe. Such a raw `console` object should only be handled by very
trustworthy code.

## `errorTaming` Options

**Background**: The error system of JavaScript has several safety problems.
In most JavaScript engines running normal JavaScript, if `err` is an
Error instance, the expression `err.stack` will produce a string
revealing the stack trace. This is an
[overt information leak, a confidentiality
violation](https://agoric.com/taxonomy-of-security-issues/).
This `stack` property reveals information about the call stack that violates
the encapsulation of the callers.

This `stack` is part of de facto JavaScript, is not yet part
of the official standard, and is proposed at
[Error Stacks proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-stacks).
Because it is unsafe, we propose that the `stack` property be "normative
optional", meaning that a conforming implementation may omit it. Further,
if present, it should be present only as a deletable accessor property
inherited from `Error.prototype` so that it can be deleted. The actual
stack information would be available by other means, the `getStack` and
`getStackString` functions&mdash;special powers available only in the start
compartment&mdash;so the SES console can still `operate` as described above.

On v8&mdash;the JavaScript engine powering Chrome, Brave, and Node&mdash;the
default error behavior is much more dangerous. The v8 `Error` constructor
provides a set of
[static methods for accessing the raw stack
information](https://v8.dev/docs/stack-trace-api) that are used to create
error stack string. Some of this information is consistent with the level
of disclosure provided by the proposed `getStack` special power above.
Some go well beyond it.

The `errorTaming` option of `lockdown` do not affect the safety of the `Error`
constructor. In all cases, after calling `lockdown`, the tamed `Error`
constructor in the start compartment follows ocap rules.
Under v8 it emulates most of the
magic powers of the v8 `Error` constructor&mdash;those consistent with the
level of disclosure of the proposed `getStack`. In all cases, the `Error`
constructor shared by all other compartments is both safe and powerless.

See the [error README](./src/error/README.md) for an in depth explanation of the
relationship between errors, `assert` and the virtual `console`.

```js
lockdown(); // errorTaming defaults to 'safe'
// or
lockdown({ errorTaming: 'safe' }); // Deny unprivileged access to stacks, if possible
// vs
lockdown({ errorTaming: 'unsafe' }); // stacks also available by errorInstance.stack
```

The `errorTaming` default `'safe'` setting makes the stack trace inaccessible
from error instances alone, when possible. It currently does this only on
v8 (Chrome, Brave, Node). It will also do so on SpiderMonkey (Firefox).
Currently is it not possible for the SES-shim to hide it on other
engines, leaving this information leak available. Note that it is only an
information leak. It reveals the magic information only as a powerless
string. This leak threatens
[confidentiality but not integrity](https://agoric.com/taxonomy-of-security-issues/).

Since the current JavaScript de facto reality is that the stack is only
available by saying `err.stack`, a number of development tools assume they
can find it there. When the information leak is tolerable, the `'unsafe'`
setting will preserve the filtered stack information on the `err.stack`.

## `stackFiltering` Options

**Background**: The error stacks shown by many JavaScript engines are
voluminous.
They contain many stack frames of functions in the infrastructure, that is
usually irrelevant to the programmer trying to disagnose a bug. The SES-shim's
`console`, under the default `consoleTaming` option of `'safe'`, is even more
voluminous&mdash;displaying "deep stack" traces, tracing back through the
[eventually sent messages](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-eventual-send)
from other turns of the event loop. In Endo (TODO docs forthcoming) these deep
stacks even cross vat/process and machine boundaries, to help debug distributed
bugs.

```js
lockdown(); // stackFiltering defaults to 'concise'
// or
lockdown({ stackFiltering: 'concise' }); // Preserve important deep stack info
// vs
lockdown({ stackFiltering: 'verbose' }); // Console shows full deep stacks
```

When looking at deep distributed stacks, in order to debug distributed
computation, seeing the full stacks is overwhelmingly noisy. The error stack
proposal leaves it to the host what stack trace info to show. SES virtualizes
elements of the host. With this freedom in mind, when possible, the SES-shim
filters and transforms the stack trace information it shows to be more useful,
by removing information that is more an artifact of low level infrastructure.
The SES-shim currently does so only on v8.

However, sometimes your bug might be in that infrastrusture, in which case
that information is no longer an extraneous distraction. Sometimes the noise
you filter out actually contains the signal you're looking for. The
`'verbose'` setting shows, on the console, the full raw stack information
for each level of the deep stacks.
Either setting of `stackFiltering` setting is safe. Stack information will
or will not be available from error objects according to the `errorTaming`
option and the platform error behavior.

## `overrideTaming` Options

**Background**: JavaScript suffers from the so-called
[override mistake](https://web.archive.org/web/20141230041441/http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:fixing_override_mistake),
which prevents lockdown from _simply_ hardening all the primordials. Rather,
for each of
[these data properties](src/enablements.js), we convert it to an accessor
property whose getter and setter emulate [a data property without the override
mistake](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/1320). For non-reflective code
the illusion is perfect. But reflective code sees that it is an accessor
rather than a data property. We add an `originalValue` property to the getter
of that accessor, letting reflective code know that a getter alleges that it
results from this transform, and what the original data value was. This enables
a form of cooperative emulation, where that code can decide whether to uphold
the illusion by pretending it sees the data property that would have been there.

The VSCode debugger's object inspector shows the own properties of an object,
which is a great aid to debugging. Unfortunately, it also shows the inherited
accessor properties, with one line for the getter and another line for the
setter. As we enable override on more properties of widely used prototypes,
we become compatible with more legacy code, but at the price of a significantly
worse debugging experience. Expand the "Expand for..." items at the end of this
section for screenshots showing the different experiences.

Enablements have a further debugging cost. When single stepping *into* code,
we now step into every access to an enabled property. Every read steps into
the enabling getter. This adds yet more noise to the debugging experience.

The file [src/enablements.js](src/enablements.js) exports two different
whitelists definining which data properties to convert to enable override by
assignment, `moderateEnablements` and `minEnablements`.

```js
lockdown(); // overrideTaming defaults to 'moderate'
// or
lockdown({ overrideTaming: 'moderate' }); // Moderate mitigations for legacy compat
// vs
lockdown({ overrideTaming: 'min' }); // Minimal mitigations for purely modern code
```

The `overrideTaming` default `'moderate'` option of `lockdown` is intended to
be fairly minimal, but we expand it as needed, when we
encounter code which should run under SES but is prevented from doing so
by the override mistake. As we encouter these we list them in the comments
next to each enablement. This process has rapidly converged. We rarely come
across any more such cases. ***If you find one, please file an issue.*** Thanks.

The `'min'` enablements setting serves two purposes: it enables a pleasant
debugging experience in VSCode, and it helps ensure that new code does not
depend on anything more than these being enabled, which is good practice.
All code authored by Agoric will be compatible with both settings, but
Agoric currently still pulls in some third party dependencies only compatible
with the `'moderate'` setting.

The following screenshots shows inspection of the `{ abc: 123 }` object, both
by hover and in the rightmost "VARIABLES" pane.
Only the `abc` property is normally useful. All other lines are noise introduced
by our override mitigation.
